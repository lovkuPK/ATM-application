This is ATM console line interface program.

Here you can find the following functionality:

1) Logging-in to machine via userNumber and password;
2) Two types of accounts:
- checking account
- saving account
3) Ability to withdraw and deposit money;
4) Ability to transfer funds from one account to another
(**added with the second commit**);
5) Time-out ability to exit the application, if no login or
PIN-code were entered (**added with the third commit**);
6) The ability to view all transactions performed
during the session (in logging format; **added with the fourth commit**).

P.S. OptionMenu class is obsolete, because it does not
contain point #5. It is included to repo for a reference.

Another fixes and extensions, additions will come later.
